	<h2>Spirited Away and the Sophistication of Childhood</h2>
	<p>In the garden of wonderments that is the body of work by Japanese animation master Hayao Miyazaki, his 2001 gem Spirited Away is at once one of his most accessible films to a Western audience and the one most distinctly rooted in Japanese culture and lore. The tale of Chihiro, a 10-year-old girl who resents being moved away from all her friends, only to find herself working in a bathhouse for the gods, doesn’t just use its home country’s fraught relationship with deities as a backdrop. It takes an Alice in Wonderland-style narrative as a springboard to deal with the subject head on.</p>
